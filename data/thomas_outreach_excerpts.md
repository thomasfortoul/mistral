## 1) Ultra-short taglines (pick one)
- “High-agency builder who learns fast and ships.” fileciteturn1file9L61-L67  
- “Coachable engineer who iterates quickly on feedback.” fileciteturn1file9L65-L67  
- “Engineer who’s shipped AI in regulated workflows.” fileciteturn1file10L1-L3

## 2) The 3-bullet ‘Why hire me’ template (tight)
Use this structure for “Why hire you?” answers:

1) **Fast builder:** I solo-designed, built, and deployed a compliant AI product used in clinics. fileciteturn1file7L19-L23  
2) **Applied AI systems:** I built agentic RAG workflows with retrieval tools and optimized for auditability. fileciteturn1file2L16-L24  
3) **Coachable + high-agency:** I’m curious, learn fast, and thrive in high-standards teams. fileciteturn1file7L44-L49 fileciteturn1file9L61-L67  

Then: **one concrete metric** (e.g., “>90% CPT identification on 500+ notes”) and a **closing question**.

## 3) “What I’m excited about” phrasing
- I’m excited about work at the intersection of powerful models and real product workflows: building interfaces and verification layers so people can trust what the model is doing. fileciteturn1file4L19-L21  
- I like turning early prototypes into something reliable and repeatable. fileciteturn1file4L1-L4  

---

## 4) Friendly closing questions (to keep it interactive)
- “Want the product angle or the systems angle?”
- “Should I go deeper on the RAG design, or the UX decisions?”
- “What would you prioritize first if I joined—features, evals, or reliability?”
