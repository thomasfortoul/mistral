## 1) 10-second summary
High-agency technical founder with a B.Sc. in Computer Science. I’ve shipped a HIPAA-compliant AI medical coding web app end-to-end, built agentic/RAG-style workflows, and I like turning strong models into real products with clean UX and solid engineering. fileciteturn1file5L2-L12

## 2) The pitch (what I want you to remember)
If you hire me, you get:
- **A fast builder** who can ship full-stack (Next.js/TS + Python + cloud) and keep the repo clean + testable. fileciteturn1file5L7-L12  
- **An applied AI engineer** who’s actually built agentic workflows with retrieval tools and iterated for real-world constraints (speed + auditability). fileciteturn1file5L8-L12  
- **A high-agency teammate** who learns fast, takes feedback seriously, and turns it into repeatable systems. fileciteturn1file5L2-L5 fileciteturn1file3L22-L24

## 3) Proof points (use these for “why hire you?”)
### Oxkair (Co-Founder, CTO) — Healthcare AI
- Built a **HIPAA-compliant AI medical coding web app** end-to-end in **under 1 month** (TypeScript, Postgres, Azure). fileciteturn1file5L7-L9  
- Built an **agentic workflow with retrieval tools**, achieving **>90% CPT identification** on **500+ operative notes**. fileciteturn1file5L8-L10  
- Added auth + role-based access control and deployed within private Azure VNets. fileciteturn1file5L10-L11  
- Optimized for clinical use: **~30s processing time**, iterated based on user feedback. fileciteturn1file5L11-L12  

### Communication / customer-facing strength
- Closed **3 deals end-to-end** (~$25K ACV, 1–5 week cycles) and improved delivery timelines by **40%** (Solar Broker). fileciteturn1file5L13-L16  
- Hosted ~20 interviews with CEOs/founders (Pioneer Series), strong in prep + structured conversations. fileciteturn1file5L27-L29  

### ML / systems experience
- Built multi-node infra + real-time ingestion + ML pipelines + retraining + alerts (Cobalt Alternative Investment). fileciteturn1file5L22-L25  
- Improved performance by **12%** with feature engineering + tuning; worked with **10,000+** time-series points. fileciteturn1file5L25-L26

## 4) How I work (tone & behaviors)
- I like steep learning curves and high standards. fileciteturn1file9L61-L67  
- I’m **coachable**: I take feedback seriously, iterate quickly, and systematize what works. fileciteturn1file3L22-L24  
- I’m product-minded: I care about clarity, auditability, and “does it actually work for the user?” fileciteturn1file4L1-L4 fileciteturn1file5L11-L12

## 5) Motivation (why Mistral / why now)
- I’m specifically interested in building **advanced AI systems that people can trust and actually use**—interfaces, workflows, and verification layers that make strong models feel reliable in practice. fileciteturn1file4L19-L21  
- I want to learn with world-class talent and ship at a very high bar.  
- I’m also personally invested in Europe’s AI future: I genuinely think **France should be a leading country in the AI race**, and I want to contribute by building excellent products.
