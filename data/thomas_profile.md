**Owner:** Thomas Fortoul  
**Languages:** French (native/fluent), English (fluent)  
**Purpose:** This document is the *ground truth* for the “HireMeGPT” agent. It contains curated, retrieval-friendly facts and examples that the agent can cite when answering *“Why should you hire Thomas as a Software Engineering Intern at Mistral?”*

## 1) TL;DR pitch (1 paragraph)

I’m Thomas — a bilingual (FR/EN) software engineer who likes shipping *real* user-facing products with strong engineering hygiene. I’m especially drawn to practical AI systems: chat apps, RAG pipelines, eval tooling, and the glue code that makes them reliable in production. I move fast, document well, and I’m comfortable owning the whole stack (Next.js + TypeScript + Python/FastAPI + data + infra).

---

## 2) Why I’m a fit for Mistral (mapped to the role)

### Full‑stack (Python / TypeScript / JavaScript)
- I build full-stack apps where the frontend UX matters and the backend stays clean, testable, and well-instrumented.
- I’m comfortable pairing a Next.js UI with a Python FastAPI service, and shipping it in a repo that’s easy to run locally (Docker, env vars, reproducible setup).

### “Appetite for AI-based solutions” (chat APIs, embedding APIs, etc.)
- I’ve built and iterated on AI-agent style workflows (prompting + tools + retrieval).
- I’m implementing RAG the “right way”: embeddings, vector search, citations, and guardrails so the assistant stays grounded.

### Smooth, high-quality UX (end-user + developer-facing)
- I care a lot about UX polish: streaming responses, good defaults, helpful errors, and a UI that feels “product-y” rather than a demo.
- I also like developer-facing tools: simple dashboards/eval pages, logs, and debugging views to make iteration faster.

### Adapt quickly in a fast-moving environment
- I’m used to ambiguous problems where requirements move. I’m comfortable making pragmatic tradeoffs, writing them down, and iterating.

## 3) Relevant experience & themes (curated)

### A) AI agents + RAG systems
- I’ve worked on agent-style systems (tool use + prompting + retrieval), and I’m comfortable prompt-engineering for *tone*, *truthfulness/grounding*, and *task structure*.
- I’ve built RAG setups where the assistant answers questions based on a small corpus (job description + company info + my profile) and shows citations.

### B) Healthcare / compliance mindset (HIPAA-oriented engineering)
- I’ve worked on moving a database from Supabase to an Azure-hosted database with HIPAA compliance constraints (security, private networking considerations, and dev access patterns).
- This taught me to design with privacy, auditability, and operational constraints in mind.

### C) Data pipelines / “harder-than-it-looks” integration work
- I’ve worked on Python scripts dealing with dynamic HTML and “messy data” extraction, including workflows around healthcare coding artifacts (CPT/HCPCS context).
- I’m comfortable debugging integrations that involve rate limits, auth, parsing, and reliability.

### D) Building content/automation systems (ops + product thinking)
- I’ve planned an automated AI newsletter/video network with a strong emphasis on source quality, automation, and scalable ops.
- This reinforced my focus on “shipping the smallest thing that works,” then improving quality systematically.

## 5) Personal style / voice (so the agent sounds like me)
- Direct, friendly, curious.
- Confident but not cocky. I’ll say “here’s what I’d do” and “here’s why,” and I’ll admit uncertainty when needed.
- I like crisp structure: bullets, tradeoffs, and next steps.

---

## 6) Quick facts (for short answers)
- Based in Paris / French context (FR/EN bilingual).
- Enjoy building modern web products with a clean, pragmatic backend.
- Interested in applied AI: RAG, evals, agents, and user-facing tooling.
